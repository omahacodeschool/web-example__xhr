This is a simple example of using JavaScript's XHR object to make requests behind the scenes.

To run this locally, fork/clone as you usually would, and then run `http-server` from the project's directory. Then visit <http://localhost:8080>.

(This assumes you've already run `npm install http-server -g` at some point to install the `http-server` utility.)
